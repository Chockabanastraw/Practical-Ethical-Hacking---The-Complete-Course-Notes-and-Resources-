# Practical-Ethical-Hacking---The-Complete-Course-Notes-and-Resources-


This repository contains Notes and Resources associated with my studies. The specified course in this repository is
"Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course". This is a beginner course.

Search by Module # .pdf for notes, and Resource Module # for Resources
associated with that module. 

Modules #1-3 pdf notes do not contain much information as they are not to the "meat" of the course
yet.

This is the first repository of many that will document my education/journey
toward a successful career in red hat security and help give back to the hacking community.
